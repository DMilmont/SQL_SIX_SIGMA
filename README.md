# SQL_SIX_SIGMA
Six Sigma with SQL

Quite often in my line of work I am asked for what processes are out of controlwhich metrics are out of control. This led to me just quering the data and flagging the standard deviations (sigmas) as Green, Yellow, and Red. I found this to be quick and useful for a lot of people. 

Thought I would share some of my queries I have used.
